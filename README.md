### Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States -- Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The code will import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. The code will also take in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
