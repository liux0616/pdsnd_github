### Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States -- Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The code will import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. The code will also take in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Code Explanation
The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change! There are four questions that will change the answers:

  1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
  2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
  3. (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
  4. (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?
